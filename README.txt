In this maze, where paths are wide,
You've stumbled here, by some curious tide.
In lines of code and in neat arrays,
READMEs sometimes greet you in unusual ways.

A file often skimmed, sometimes unseen,
Holds a message here, in the machine's serene.
It's not just text, nor mundane guide,
But a poetic surprise, tucked deep inside.

So pause a while in your pursuit,
As words blend with code, in an unlikely suit.
In this realm of bytes, where secrets hide,
Who thought a README could be your guide?

A gentle nudge in the digital dance,
A poetic twist, in a glance.
Who knew this path, so routinely trod,
Would hold a verse, a wink, a nod.

In the world of code, where secrets sleep,
This README's verse, a promise to keep.
To remind us all, in our quests,
That even in code, poetry rests.
